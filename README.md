# Threads of Hope

###  Project Description
Threads of Hope is an interactive, narrative-driven Choose Your Own Adventure (CYOA) game built with p5.js and p5.play. Players explore a story where their choices influence the outcome, manage a hope meter and interact with a virtual dog companion.

### Why I Made This
I wanted to create something that was not just a game, but an experience. Hope is a powerful emotion and I wanted players to feel how small choices can build (or break) it.

###  Features
- Multiple Branching Paths: Each decision shapes the story and leads to unique endings.
- Hope Meter: Reflects the player’s emotional state and choices throughout the game.
- Interactive Pet Companion: Players can pet and interact with a dog that responds dynamically.
- Dynamic Backgrounds: Scenes change based on the story progression and player choices.
- Interactions: Players can interact with sprites which influences much bigger decisions.

### How I Built It
- Language / Libraries: JavaScript + p5.js + p5.play.
- I worked on this entirely in Replit, coding and testing iteratively.

### Struggles & What I Learned
Struggles:
- Sprite Animation Pain: Getting animation frames to was way trickier than expected. Debugging took forever T_T.
- Lining the sprites up correctly on every screen was tricky as well.

Learned:
- How to better structure projects with multiple scenes.
- How to combine storytelling logic with actual game logic.
- Those debugging sprite animations are basically a thrilling horror game itself :D.

### Final Thoughts
This project took about 16–17 hours, but it was so worth it! I walked away with sharper coding skills, a deeper love for narrative games, and one very patient (and well-petted) virtual dog.
